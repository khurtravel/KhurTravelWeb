# Clean URLs and SSL Setup for Khur Travel Mongolia Website

This document explains how the clean URL system and SSL configuration work for the khurmongoliatravel.com website.

## What Has Been Implemented

We've set up the following features for your website:

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic is forced to use HTTPS
2. **Clean URLs**: No .html extensions are shown in the browser URL
3. **Fixed Image Paths**: All images load correctly regardless of URL structure
4. **Fixed Internal Links**: All links between pages work properly
5. **GitHub Pages Optimization**: Configuration specifically for GitHub Pages hosting
6. **SEO Improvements**: Added sitemap.xml and robots.txt files

## How It Works

### Clean URLs

The clean URL system uses three methods to ensure URLs don't show .html extensions:

1. **Jekyll Configuration**: The `_config.yml` file includes `permalink: pretty` which tells GitHub Pages to use clean URLs

2. **JavaScript URL Handler**: The `js/url-handler.js` script modifies URLs in the browser to hide .html extensions:
   - When clicking links, it removes .html extensions
   - On page load, it removes .html from the current URL
   - It handles browser back/forward navigation

3. **.htaccess Rules**: For traditional hosting, URL rewrite rules in `.htaccess` handle clean URLs on the server side

### Image Path Fixing

Images are ensured to load correctly using:

1. **Consistent Path Format**: All image paths now start with a forward slash (`/images/` or `/img/`)

2. **JavaScript Path Corrector**: The `js/image-path-corrector.js` script automatically tries different path variations if an image fails to load

3. **Lowercase Image Names**: All image filenames have been converted to lowercase for consistency

### SSL Configuration

SSL is enforced through:

1. **CNAME Configuration**: The `CNAME` file contains your domain name (khurmongoliatravel.com)

2. **Enforce HTTPS Script**: The `js/enforce-https.js` script redirects any HTTP traffic to HTTPS

3. **Security Headers**: Added security headers like Content-Security-Policy to ensure all resources load securely

4. **GitHub Pages Settings**: The `_config.yml` includes `enforce_ssl: khurmongoliatravel.com`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload all files to your GitHub repository

2. In GitHub repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Set the source branch to your main branch
   - Enter "khurmongoliatravel.com" as your custom domain
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS"

3. Make sure your domain registrar has the correct DNS settings:
   - Add an A record pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses:
     ```
     185.199.108.153
     185.199.109.153
     185.199.110.153
     185.199.111.153
     ```
   - Or add a CNAME record pointing to your GitHub Pages URL

## Testing

To verify everything is working correctly:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Copy the contents of `final-verification.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to run the verification

The verification script will check:
- If base href is set correctly
- If all scripts are loaded
- If all internal links use clean URLs
- If all images are loading properly
- If HTTPS is enforced
- If the current URL is clean

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Broken Images
- Check browser console for image loading errors
- Verify image paths in HTML and CSS files
- Ensure all image filenames are lowercase

### Clean URLs Not Working
- Make sure `permalink: pretty` is in your `_config.yml`
- Check that `url-handler.js` is loaded on all pages
- Verify that GitHub Pages is configured correctly

### SSL Issues
- Ensure DNS settings are correctly pointing to GitHub Pages
- Check that "Enforce HTTPS" is enabled in GitHub Pages settings
- Verify that `enforce-https.js` is loaded on all pages
